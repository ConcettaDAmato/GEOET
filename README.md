# GEOET
GEOET is a Java-based modeling environment to simulate evapotranspiration flow

GEOET is a new release of ETP-GEOframe model. It presents a new structure of the java classes and methods. 
This release allows the users to compute 
- potential and actual soil evaporation using the Penman Monteith FAO model
- potential and actual evapotraspiration according two different methods:
  - Priestley Taylor model
  - Penman Montheith FAO model
- potential and actual transpiration according Schimansky and Or method, implemented in the Prospero model 
- potential and actual evapotranspiration combining Prospero model for the transpiration and Penman Montheith FAO model for the soil evaporation.
